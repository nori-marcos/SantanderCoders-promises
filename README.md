## Description
The coding challenge was proposed as follows:
- Create a HTML with a ``<h1>`` containing the name "Desafio Promises (and your name)"
- The page needs to have a button named "Gerar Lista" (Generate List)
- The button calls three promises that require different time intervals for completion.
- Each promise must be resolved creating an array that receives a random length (``Math.random*10``)
- Each array must fulfill the random length with random numbers (``Math.random*10``).
- The result should be displayed on the screen
  
## Technology used
